  info: 'The Park was opened to the public in 1870 and was designed by Alexander Hennell. The design of the Park was experimental in its use of oval shaped and curved pathways, which contrasted with the more rigid geometry seen previously in Victorian landscapes. It is located between the vibrant communities of Whalley Range & Moss Side, just off Princess Road and covers 60 acres.',
